        <h2 class="abouth2">Hi, I'm Stephanie!</h2>
        <p class="aboutp">I am a recent graduate from UMass Amherst, where I studied English with specializations in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communication</a> & <a href= "https://www.umass.edu/english/study-and-practice-writing" target="_blank">the Study and Practice of Writing</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutp">I currently hold two positions: one with UMass IT Communications, where I'm a Content Coordinator and assist with technical writing and documentation; and the other with the UMass International Programs Office, where I'm a Communications Coordinator. During my time at UMass, I was a peer tutor in the UMass Writing Center and worked as a fiction editor on <i>Jabberwocky</i>, UMass's official undergraduate literary journal.</p>
        <p class="aboutp">In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, though that mostly involves sitting in front of a blank page and waiting for my novels to write themselves. I'm also an avid reader, if by avid I mean I love buying new books, only to continue rereading my favorites over and over again.</p> 
        <p class="aboutp">After graduation, I moved back to my hometown of Silver Spring, Maryland, where I spend most of my time complaining about the humidity and dousing my food in Old Bay.</p>
