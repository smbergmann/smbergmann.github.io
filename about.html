        <h2 class="abouth2">Hi, I'm Stephanie!</h2>
        
        <p class="aboutp">I'm a technical writer currently seeking a position in software and/or cybersecurity. Prior to a company-wide round of layoffs that impacted my role, I worked for <a href="https://www.f5.com/" target="_blank">F5's</a> App Infrastructure Protection (AIP) product group as a technical writer for just over a year. There, I documented the work of four 10-15 person software engineering teams and managed all user interface documentation, API documentation, and release notes. </p>
        
        <p class="aboutp">In 2021, I graduated from UMass Amherst with a Bachelor of Arts in English and certificates in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communication (PWTC)</a> and <a href= "https://www.umass.edu/english/study-and-practice-writing" target="_blank">The Study and Practice of Writing (SPOW)</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="aboutp">After graduating, I held two concurrent positions within UMass Amherst: one as Content Coordinator with UMass IT Communications, where I continued my Summer 2020 internship that focused on technical writing; and the other as Communications Coordinator for the UMass International Programs Office, where I handled marketing strategy, graphic design, and social media.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutp">In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, though that mostly involves sitting in front of a blank page and waiting for my novels to write themselves. I'm also an avid reader, and love going to concerts, and swimming.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutp">I currently live in my hometown of Silver Spring, Maryland, where I spend most of my time complaining about the humidity and dousing my food in Old Bay.</p>
